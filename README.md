# Bitcoin-trading
Bitcoin, or talking in a more general term: cryptocurrency, has caught many experts and researchers' attention regarding to its similarity of trading in financial market and its volatility in price. Cryptocurrencies have the potential to make the world better by letting any two people in the world exchange money directly, without involving a financial institution or government. Experts often talk about the many ways crypto can address the shortcomings of our current financial system. Things like high fees, identity theft, and extreme economic inequality are an unfortunate part of our current financial system and they’re also things crypto has the potential to address. This is called Decnetralized Finance. 
One of the key reasons that I choose the Applied Analytics minor is to use data analysis as a tool to discover some insights behind business world. As a student major in Economics, I am interested in cryptocurrency and decided to research on the profitability of different cryptocurrencies.

Guiding Questions:
1. Which base currency has the most profit?
2. Which quote currency has the most profit?
3. Which exchange is more profitable? 

In order to analyze these questions, I collected the historical trading data for several different kinds of cryptocurrencies, including the ones the most famous Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and the cryptocurrencies I introduced above. The timeframe is across April to May and the number of total trade is 8073. Let me further explain the questions: cryptocurrency trading are usually conducted through exchanging the base currency and quote currency, both of the currencies could be cryptocurrencies or USD, and the exchange rate follow the price of the two exchanging currencies. These trading actions happend on certain decentralized trading platform and we call it exchange.
